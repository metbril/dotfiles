# Bitwarden CLI Vault Export Script
# Author: David H (@dh024)
# https://github.com/dh024/Bitwarden_Export
#  
# This script will backup the following:
#   - personal vault contents, password encrypted (or unencrypted)
#   - organizational vault contents (passwd encrypted or unencrypted)
#   - file attachments
# It will also report on whether there were items in the Trash that
# could not be exported.
